# STM32G0CubeAssembly
This Project carried out at the National Engineering School
of Tunis,with collaboration of ST Microelectonics Tunis,aims at the Assembly language
micro-code generation of STM32G0-discovery board. The objective of this project
is to facilitate the configuration of the peripherals with assembly code using the
STM32G0-discovery board by developing a graphical interface that generates an
assembly code automatically
Covred peripherals : Input,Output,Timer,ADC,USART
