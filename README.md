# STM32G0 Assembly Code Generator

This project, developed during the 2022/2023 academic year at the **National Engineering School of Tunis**, in collaboration with **ST Microelectronics Tunis**, aims at generating assembly language micro-code for the STM32G0-Discovery board. The goal is to facilitate peripheral configuration by providing a graphical interface that automatically generates the necessary assembly code.

## Overview

The main objective of this project is to develop a tool that simplifies the configuration of STM32G0-Discovery board peripherals using assembly language. The graphical interface enables users to configure settings easily, and it automatically generates the corresponding assembly code.

This project was carried out as a part of the curriculum at the National Engineering School of Tunis in collaboration with ST Microelectronics during the academic year 2022/2023.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** User-friendly interface for configuring STM32G0-Discovery board peripherals.
- **Assembly Code Generation:** Automatic generation of assembly code based on the user's peripheral configuration.
- **Peripheral Support:** Provides support for configuring various peripherals (GPIO, UART, etc.) of the STM32G0 board.
- **Microcontroller:** Designed specifically for the STM32G0 family.
