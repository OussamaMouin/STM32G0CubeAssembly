# STM32G0CubeAssembly
This Project carried out at the National Engineering School of Tunis,with collaboration of ST Microelectonics Tunis,aims at the Assembly language
micro-code generation of STM32G0-discovery board. The objective of this project is to facilitate the configuration of the peripherals with assembly code using the
STM32G0-discovery board by developing a graphical interface that generates the configuration code in
assembly automatically

## Examples
In this project we tested our developed interface generated configuration code to assure its functionality. The configured peripherals are the folowing:
<ul>
  <li>GPIO</li>
  <li>ADC</li>
  <li>TIMER</li>
  <li>USART</li>
</ul>
